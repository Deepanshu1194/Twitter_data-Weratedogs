# Twitter_data-Weratedogs
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

Introduction
This report presents an analysis and visualization of data from the Twitter account @dog_rates, which rates and reviews different breeds of dogs. The analysis includes calculating the percent of top breeds of dogs in the columns p1, p2, and p3, identifying the tweet with the highest number of favorites, and identifying the tweet with the highest number of retweets. The findings of the analysis are visualized through the use of bar graphs and pie charts.

Insight #1:
The analysis found that the top breeds of dogs in the p1, p2, and p3 columns are Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, and Labrador Retriever, respectively. The number of occurrences of these breeds in each column was also calculated, with 139 occurrences of Golden Retriever in p1, 96 occurrences of Labrador Retriever in p2, and 76 occurrences of Labrador Retriever in p3. The total percent of each breed in its respective column was also calculated, with 7% of the values in p1 being Golden Retrievers, 5% of the values in p2 being Labrador Retrievers, and 4% of the values in p3 being Labrador Retrievers. This distribution is shown in the following pie chart:
